    Use the ``getCurrentDraft()`` function in ``utils.py`` for a simpler
    interface to get hold of (and optionally create on-demand) a draft.

    Use the ``IDraftStorage`` utility to access specific drafts.

    This interface allows the add/edit form integration to get and set the
    basic values that identify a draft: the user id, the target object key,
    and the draft name.

    The current draft information may be persisted across requests by calling
    ``save()``. Once saved, it can be later discard by calling ``save()``.

    The deafult implementation stores information in cookies that are set
    when the form is entered and cleared when it is saved or cancelled. The
    cookes are set for a path corresponding to the content object. This allows
    things like AJAX requests in the visual editor to find the same draft
    information, and minimises the risk of a draft for one object being used
    for another.

    The default path may be obtained via the ``defaultPath`` property, but
    an explicit path may be set. If set, it is persisted when ``save()`` is
    called. This is done to allow the draft information to be saved or
    updated with the same path as a previously created draft.

    The ``mark()`` method may be called to optionally mark the request with
    ``IDrafting`` if draft information (at least user id and target key) has
    been set.
